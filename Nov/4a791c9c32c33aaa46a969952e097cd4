A Thai classic, this head-clearing broth is very easily made. Pretty much all the love goes into the base paste, and it's worth making double and keeping half, either in a jar in the fridge for a week or in the freezer for a month. Lime leaves are found in the fridge or freezer of most Asian shops, and some supermarkets. Serves four The paste ¼ bulb garlic, cloves peeled1½ sticks lemongrass, roughly chopped 35g root ginger, sliced3 lime leaves35g coriander, chopped (keep a few sprigs for the end)1-1½ red chillis (depending on how hot you like it),roughly chopped 1½-2 shallots, peeled40ml sunflower or groundnut oil The rest 1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk 200g fresh or frozen peas (if fresh, use 1kg unshelled pods)200g button mushrooms, sliced2 tomatoes200g beansprouts1 lime1 spring onion, thinly sliced on a serious diagonalA few sprigs of coriander, to finishSalt and pepper Put all the paste ingredients into a blender and blitz to a fine puree. In a hot pan, stir the paste for a few minutes to release the flavours. Now add 400ml of water, the coconut milk and a pinch of salt. Bring to a gentle simmer. Turn the heat off and stir in the peas and mushrooms. Cut the tomatoes into thin wedges and divide between four warmed bowls along with the beansprouts. Check the seasoning and finish with a hefty squeeze of lime. Divide the very hot soup between the bowls. Finish with some shards of spring onion and a sprig of coriander. • Allegra McEvedy is co-founder of the fast-food chain Leon.
